JavaScript is not a class-based object-oriented language. But it still has ways of using object oriented programming (OOP).

In this tutorial, I'll explain OOP and show you how to use it.

According to Wikipedia, class-based programming is

a style of Object-oriented programming (OOP) in which inheritance occurs via defining classes of objects, instead of inheritance occurring via the objects alone

The most popular model of OOP is class-based.

But as I mentioned, JavaScript isn't a classed-based langauge â€“ it's is a prototype-based langauge.

According to Mozilla's documentaion:

A prototype-based language has the notion of a prototypical object, an object used as a template from which to get the initial properties for a new object.
